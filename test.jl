# Default population:
#   - Three strategies
#   - Two groups of sizes ~ [0.5,0.5]
#   - Public individual and public group reputations
#   - Randomly use individual or group (fixed value of p=0.5)
#   - Update reputations every round (fixed value of Î»=1.0 )
#   - Individual and group reputations based on behavior
#   - Both individual and group reps using individual previous reps as source

# Changing variables
# Example:
#   - Private individual and group reputations
#   - Three groups with different sizes
#   - Individuals that use only individual, only group and randomly both reps
#   - Half of individuals update every round and other half do not update
